     * ============================================================================================================
     * 
     * -- INTRODUCTION --
     * This is a sample plugin that will appear inside the Plugins section of CyberBulletPlugin.
     * Make sure to read all comments to understand what everything is doing, and feel free to experiment with it.
     * 
     * -- BUILDING --
     * This project must reference RuriLib and PluginFramework, which are available at https://t.me/ghoulblack/1967
     * and are also included in this sample project (but they will not be kept up to date).
     * When you compile this project, it will output a DLL file that you need to place in OpenBullet's Plugins folder,
     * and then restart OpenBullet in order for it to work.
     * 
     * -- DEPENDENCIES --
     * If you want to load any dependencies you will be able to do so by moving all the DLLs into a subfolder with the
     * same name as the master DLL, for example something like this:
     * Plugins/
     * Plugins/Example.dll
     * Plugins/Example/Dependency.dll
     * 
     * Note: If you want to add a dependency that OpenBullet already depends on (e.g. Newtonsoft.Json) you MUST make sure
     * to use the EXACT SAME VERSION that OpenBullet uses when you compile the plugin (it's easy to just copy the DLL file from
     * OpenBullet's folder and reference that instead of the nuget package which might be more updated), and finally you MUST NOT INCLUDE
     * the DLL of that dependency in the subfolder since OpenBullet already loads it by default.
     *
